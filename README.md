# Selenium-javaSerenityBDD

The project framework used is called Serenity BDD. 

Serenity BDD helps you write cleaner and more maintainable automated acceptance and regression tests faster. Serenity also uses the test results to produce illustrated, narrative reports that document and describe what your application does and how it works. Serenity tells you not only what tests have been executed, but more importantly, what requirements have been tested.

The project was configured to be able to run against any of the 3 different browsers- Chrome, Edge or Firefox

To Execute:

1. Clone into the repository
2. Import the cloned project into your IDE (Preferably Eclipse)
3. Run as JUnit - AcceptanceTestSuite.java (pre-configured to run with Chrome browser). To change the browser, simply edit the "browser" variable in the serenities.properties file. Example: to run with Firefox, simply edit the browser variable to "Firefox"
